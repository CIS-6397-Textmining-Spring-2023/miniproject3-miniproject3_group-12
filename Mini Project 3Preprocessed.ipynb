       " 'WASHINGTON -- President Trump is shifting more authority over military operations to the Pentagon, according to White House officials, reversing what his aides and some generals say was a tendency by the Obama White House to micromanage issues better left to military commanders.',\n",
       " \"The change is at the heart of a re-engineering of the National Security Council's role under its new leader, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and reflects Mr. Trump's belief that the N.S.C. should focus less on military operations and tactics and more on strategic issues. A guiding precept for the president and his team is that the balance of power in the world has shifted against American interests, and that General McMaster should focus on developing foreign and economic policy options in concert with the Pentagon, State Department and other agencies to respond to that challenge.\",\n",
       " 'The new approach to managing military operations was evident this month when a Marine artillery battery and a team of Army Rangers -- some 400 troops in all -- arrived in northern Syria. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed off on the deployments and notified the White House. But General McMaster neither convened a meeting at the White House to discuss whether to send the forces nor presented the Pentagon with questions about where, precisely, the troops would operate or what risks they might confront.',\n",
       " 'Though the streamlined decision-making has been welcomed by many in the military, it could raise questions about whether Mr. Trump, who has drawn heavily from current and former generals to fill key jobs in his administration, is exercising sufficient oversight.',\n",
       " \"For President Trump, it is very early days, but he appears to be going back to a model of greater delegation of authority, said Mich√®e A. Flournoy, who was the Pentagon's top policy official under President Barack Obama and is the chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based policy group.\",\n",
       " 'The benefit is that it allows the military campaign to go forward without undue pauses, interruptions or delays, Ms. Flournoy added. That enables it to create more momentum and to be more responsive to changes on the battlefield. But there is a risk if there is inadequate oversight and the president stops playing close attention. It can be detrimental, even dangerous, if a commander in chief does not feel ownership of the campaign or loses touch with how things are evolving on the ground.',\n",
       " \"Mr. Trump has already drawn criticism for being quick to approve the military's plans to carry out a raid in Yemen in January that led to the death of one American commando and at least several civilians. The United States also conducted an airstrike last week in Syria that the American military said killed dozens of Qaeda fighters but that local activists said hurt civilians.\",\n",
       " \"At the same time, Mr. Trump has yet to announce a new strategy to defeat the Islamic State, something he repeatedly said during the presidential campaign that he would do. That suggests that Mr. Trump's main contribution may be to ensure that the basic strategy he inherited is carried out more quickly.\",\n",
       " 'General McMaster -- who replaced a retired general, Michael T. Flynn, whose tumultuous tenure as national security adviser lasted less than a month -- has a reputation as a strategic thinker. So far, he has not undertaken any fundamental restructuring of the N.S.C., according to White House officials who did not want to be identified because they were discussing internal planning. But he has made some appointments to assist in the effort to forge a new strategy.',\n",
       " \"Dina Powell, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for economic initiatives, has been named the deputy national security adviser for strategy to spearhead the preparation of policy options and oversee their execution once Mr. Trump decides on them.\",\n",
       " \"Nadia Schadlow, a former Pentagon official and the author of a recent book that examined cases in which the United States Army intervened abroad, was hired to draft a security strategy. In the past, that document has often been little more than a rehash of the White House's policies, but for a Trump administration struggling to translate its promise to make America great again into a coherent foreign and economic agenda, it might emerge as an important statement.\",\n",
       " \"How General McMaster will navigate rival centers of power within the White House that have their own deep-seated views on security policy remains to be seen. When Mr. Mattis hosted the Saudi defense minister at the Pentagon on Thursday, General McMaster was one of five White House officials who attended the meeting. The others were Stephen K. Bannon, who remains a full member of the National Security Council's principals committee; Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law; Ms. Powell; and Derek Harvey, the chief Middle East expert on the N.S.C. staff.\",\n",
       " \"General McMaster's problem is not how to deal with defense secretary and other principals; it is how to deal with the many competing powers in the White House, said Ivo Daalder, the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the co-author of a book on the National Security Council. That was underscored when five senior White House officials traipsed over to the Pentagon for a meeting that normally might be attended by a single N.S.C. aide.\",\n",
       " \"An immediate focus for General McMaster, however, is making good on Mr. Trump's vow during his speech to a joint session of Congress last month to demolish and destroy the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Mr. Trump, who claimed during the campaign to have a secret plan to defeat the militant group, instructed the Pentagon and other key agencies in late January to submit a preliminary plan within 30 days to do so.\",\n",
       " 'More than seven weeks later, no new strategy has been announced, and there has been some speculation that the White House will not decide one key question -- whether to arm the Kurdish Y.P.G. militia in Syria -- until after a Turkish referendum on April 16 on whether to expand the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. While American commanders generally believe that the militia would greatly help what is expected to be a hard-fought operation to take Raqqa, Syria, the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State, Turkey has denounced the group as a terrorist organization.',\n",
       " \"The steps the Trump administration has taken so far, such as deploying Marine artillery in Syria, generally reflect the Obama administration's approach of providing firepower and advisers so local forces can do the main fighting on the ground.\",\n",
       " \"But while it still expects the White House to be consulted, the Trump administration is prepared to give the Pentagon more leeway in deploying forces than the Obama administration did. The Obama White House's scrutiny of military deployments reflected its fear of being drawn into a quagmire, as well as strains with the military that went back to 2009 deliberations over Afghanistan strategy.\",\n",
       " 'While the approach the Obama administration took ensured that the president was well-informed on military details, it also meant that modest steps, such as resupplying arms to Syrian fighters battling the Islamic State or sending military teams to scout out a potential base in Iraq, often could not be taken without time-consuming deliberations.',\n",
       " 'In defense of the Obama administration, every single time we went to the president and asked for something more, we eventually got it, though we often had to jump through a lot of hoops, said Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger who held a senior position at the Defense Department under Mr. Obama. The episode that took the cake was toward the end of the administration, when we literally had cabinet secretaries debating the movement of three helicopters from Iraq to Syria.',\n",
       " \"While it remains unclear whether the new administration will come up with a strategy significantly different from its predecessor's, the Trump team may have an effect on how the one it inherited is carried out.\",\n",
       " \"Potentially, by giving field commanders more leeway to exploit opportunities on the battlefield, the Trump administration can execute the Obama administration's strategy more efficiently, Mr. Exum said.\",\n",

       " \"Politics is something like an art, if you ask those who practice it, and it's something like a science, if you ask those who study it. But to the journalists who cover it, it has always been something like something else: a sport. Writing in 1968, Milton Rokeach, the social psychologist, articulated what would become a perennial complaint. The kinds of data obtained by public-opinion research and disseminated in the mass media seem designed more to entertain than to inform, he wrote. The quality of the information conveyed seems not much different from that conveyed in the sports pages or, better yet, the daily racing form. The press, especially during election years, frequently failed to exercise journalistic conscience; it had internalized a racehorse philosophy.\",\n",
       " \"Nearly half a century later, Rokeach's assessment still echoes in our gripes about political news. His chosen metaphor, however, has been beaten to death. Coverage is now turning away from a language of sports and toward a language of war. The horse race has given way to an arms race, in which everything, and everyone, have the potential to be weaponized.\",\n",
       " \"According to the past year in headlines, Donald Trump has amassed a particularly enormous arsenal. Since the beginning of the election, he has been credited with improvising (or trying to improvise) weapons out of everything within reach: Twitter, the dollar, conspiracy theories, fake news, harassment, Bill Clinton, emails, the media, merry Christmas, federal funding, unintelligibility and chaos -- to name just a few. Trump's opponents have taken up arms, too. Among the weaponry: Hillary Clinton's popular-vote victory, history, social media, protest and Trump's incendiary anti-Muslim election rhetoric (which was weaponized in court arguments against the travel restrictions he ordered). The left has been accused of weaponizing political correctness, weaponizing safe spaces and weaponizing racism -- meaning accusations of racial hatred, not racial hatred itself.\",\n",
       " \"Weaponization works as a throwing up of the hands, and as a suggestion -- or an admission, or a strategic claim -- that the discourse has failed us. Or, more accurately, it suggests that the discourse has become something dangerous: no mere fight but a terminal conflict without decorum or limits. The language of sports had a maddening tendency to flatten and trivialize the serious consequences of politics, creating constant suspense but obscuring life-or-death stakes. Militarized language moves in a different direction: It intensifies the news it's describing while simultaneously obscuring actual threats. Weaponization is used to describe both rhetoric that might incite violence and criticism of violent rhetoric. It is lodged against the state, with its legal monopoly on violence, but also, incoherently, against those who challenge the state. It is a shortcut to false equivalence, and it manufactures excuses for those with a vested interest in drawing blood themselves.\",\n",
       " 'As a metaphor, weaponization creates paranoia and the impression that nothing is immune from conscription. Suddenly tools for violence are hiding everywhere, waiting to be brandished by your enemies, taken up for self-defense or fatally mishandled by the blind or na√Øe. The fabric of civilian life is now wrapped in a linguistic fog of war.',\n",
       " \"Weaponize was born in the 1950s as military jargon. It was an instantly comprehensible neologism, useful and compact and inflected with the managerial style then in vogue. To turn into a weapon sounds clumsy and crude, bringing to mind early man gripping a fist-size rock or a prisoner sharpening a toothbrush. Weaponize, on the other hand, conjures thick-rimmed glasses and pomade, official reports and secret plans. It's a contemporary of collateral damage, another term emblematic of what had not yet been termed the military-industrial complex.\",\n",
       " \"Its first documented appearance in front of a wide audience came in 1957, in an Associated Press interview with Wernher von Braun, the former Nazi engineer who would become an integral figure in the American space program. Von Braun explained to the unnamed reporter that his work had been to weaponize the military's ballistic-missile technology. Army rocketry was, of course, always destined for war, so von Braun's use of the word suggested the fulfillment of a plan, more than a conversion. Over the decades that followed, weaponization proliferated alongside nuclear warheads, describing their constantly multiplying delivery systems, and lingered through the late stages of the Cold War. But it has periodically re-entered the lexicon to address fresh fears: anxiety about new infectious diseases being put to sinister ends; weapons of mass destruction, during the run-up to the first and second American wars in Iraq; and of course, 21st-century terror attacks, in which horrifying and surprising things -- passenger planes, trucks -- were converted into instruments of slaughter.\",\n",
       " \"Recently, as the word has crept into civilian life to describe an anxiety about the future, it has brought uncanny echoes of history along with it. In that 1957 interview, von Braun used the word in response to a question about the Soviet Union's technological advantages. Today it is Russia that is described -- by American intelligence figures -- as leading the way in a very different form of cutting-edge weaponization: of hackers, leaks, data dumps, social media and information in general, all aided by the machinery of the internet. This rhetorical conversion of the entire internet into a field of battle dovetails neatly with our deepening fears about technology and privacy. The notion that a state could weaponize social media for political ends is easy to understand in the familiar terms of online harassment, which turns seemingly inert platforms like Twitter or Facebook into tools for invading privacy and inflicting fear. Similarly, a nation using malware to interfere with a rival power's missile launches resembles, more than superficially, a hacker's plot to conscript your wireless baby monitor into a malicious botnet, and worries about pervasive state surveillance bring to mind our ambivalent relationships with the online services to which we hand over our most personal information. Both lines of thinking look at our technological, social and political acceleration with an extreme but appealingly simple pessimism: Whatever this is, it ends badly.\",\n",
       " \"This feeling can breed either cynicism or paranoia, calling into question not just different claims about the world but also the tools used to make them. Weaponized Narrative Is the New Battlespace, blared a January headline on Defense One, a website that covers national-security news. Weaponized narrative seeks to undermine an opponent's civilization, identity and will by generating complexity, confusion and political and social schisms, the article says, repeating the claim that Russia controlled the United States presidential election with disinformation and hacked data. The global rise of blood-and-soil nationalism, it suggests, is a result of attacks meant to tear down old identities that have bound us together.\",\n",
       " \"Russia Insider, a website broadly defensive of the country's government, treated the subject with mockery. The Western media, it wrote in March of last year, was sounding paranoid: Whatever You Can Think Of, Russia Is 'Weaponizing' It. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks -- another entity frequently accused of weaponizing information -- returned the favor in February: When you read a newspaper article, you are reading weaponized text.\",\n",
       " \"In the months since the election, as our linguistic arms race has continued to escalate, less metaphorical weapons have inauspiciously rejoined the discourse: consumer drones in Mosul, the VX nerve agent in a Malaysian airport and, in North Korea, the original weaponized weapons, ballistic missiles. Seeing these headlines side by side with articles about the weaponization of data (to win elections) and of Hollywood (to criticize the president) doesn't feel as strange as you might expect. Of course quadcopter drones have been weaponized. We're at war. Haven't you heard? They're weaponizing tweets now.\",\n",
       " 'But even as a metaphor, far away from missiles and drones and nerve agents, weaponization is disorienting. That social media can be described within a single year as having been weaponized by Barack Obama and by ISIS, by and against Hillary Clinton, by governments and by brands, by Donald Trump and by the protesters challenging him, by bots and marketers and malicious trolls targeting other users with explicitly violent threats -- all of this is a testament to how weaponization scrambles power in ways that tend to favor the actually violent. It places weapons in the hands of everyone around them, annexing their targets into a war zone where anything is permissible.',\n",

       " 'The increase, which includes a team of Army Rangers and a Marine artillery unit that have already arrived in Syria, represents a near-doubling of the number of American troops there.',\n",

       " 'The military strategy that is emerging in Syria parallels the approach that the United States has taken in Mosul, Iraq, and largely reflects the assumptions that guided the planning during the Obama administration.',\n",
       " \"In Mosul, the Americans and their allies have provided the air power, rocket fire, artillery and advisers, enabling Iraqi forces to move forward in their push to take the city's western half.\",\n",
       " 'Similarly, in the case of Raqqa, the idea is that Syrian forces will do most of the ground fighting but that Americans will assist them with advisers and firepower.',\n",
       " 'The United States is already carrying out airstrikes in Syria and has deployed Himars surface-to-surface rockets in the northern part of the country. Before he left office, President Barack Obama approved the use of a small number of Apache attack helicopters, and they are expected to be part of the Raqqa operation, as well.',\n",

       " 'I feel very comfortable with mixing Special Operations forces with conventional forces, General Votel said. That is the way we fight.',\n",

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the president was exercising his rightful authority to keep our people safe. Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned, without providing context or evidence, that more than 300 people admitted to the United States as refugees had been investigated by the F.B.I. for possible terrorism links.

The order indicated that Christian refugees would get priority over Muslims.',\n",

       " 'PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES',\n",
       " 'By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the Nation from terrorist activities by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:',\n",
       " 'Section 1. Policy and Purpose. (a) It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.',\n",
       " '(b) On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).',\n",
       " '(i) Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States. Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security: (I) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists. 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.',\n",
       " '(ii) In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries -- each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States -- would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.',\n",
       " '(iii) Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.',\n",
       " '(iv) Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities -- whoever they are and wherever they reside -- to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.',\n",
       " '(c) The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States. On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions about who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.',\n",
       " \"(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats. Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones. Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government's willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States. Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.\",\n",
       " \"(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:\",\n",
       " \"(i) Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa'ida and has permitted al-Qa'ida to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.\",\n",
       " \"(ii) Libya. Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals. In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions. Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.\",\n",
       " \"(iii) Somalia. Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa'ida-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.\",\n",
       " \"(iv) Sudan. Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas. Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa'ida and other terrorist groups to meet and train. Although Sudan's support to al-Qa'ida has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa'ida and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.\",\n",
       " \"(v) Syria. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country. At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq. ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States. The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012. Syria does not cooperate with the United States' counterterrorism efforts.\",\n",
       " \"(vi) Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks. Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen's porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities. In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country. Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.\",\n",
       " '(f) In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.',\n",
       " \"(g) Iraq presents a special case. Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq. Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government's capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents. Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq's commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq. In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States. In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.\",\n",
       " '(h) Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security. Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States. They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees. For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses. And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.',\n",
       " \"(i) Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism remains a matter of grave concern. In light of the Ninth Circuit's observation that the political branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspensions than are the courts, and in order to avoid spending additional time pursuing litigation, I am revoking Executive Order 13769 and replacing it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens.\",\n",

       " 'PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES',\n",
       " 'By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the Nation from terrorist activities by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:',\n",
       " 'Section 1. Policy and Purpose. (a) It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.',\n",
       " '(b) On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).',\n",
       " '(i) Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States. Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security: ‚ÄúI) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists.‚Äù U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.',\n",
       " '(ii) In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part: ‚Äúhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.‚Äù U.S.C. 1182(f). Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries ‚Äîach afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States ‚Äîould be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.',\n",
       " '(iii) Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.',\n",
       " '(iv) Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities ‚Äîhoever they are and wherever they reside ‚Äîo avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.',\n",
       " '(c) The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States. On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the ‚Äúolitical branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions‚Äùbout who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.',\n",
       " '(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats. Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones. Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government‚Äô willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States. Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.',\n",
       " '(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State‚Äô Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:',\n",
       " '(i) Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa‚Äôda and has permitted al-Qa‚Äôda to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.',\n",
       " '(ii) Libya. Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals. In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions. Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States‚Äôounterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.',\n",
       " '(iii) Somalia. Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa‚Äôda-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.',\n",
       " '(iv) Sudan. Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas. Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa‚Äôda and other terrorist groups to meet and train. Although Sudan‚Äô support to al-Qa‚Äôda has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States‚Äôounterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa‚Äôda and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.',\n",
       " '(v) Syria. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country. At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq. ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States. The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012. Syria does not cooperate with the United States‚Äôounterterrorism efforts.',\n",
       " '(vi) Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa‚Äôda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks. Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen‚Äô porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities. In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country. Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.',\n",
       " '(f) In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.',\n",
       " '(g) Iraq presents a special case. Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq. Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government‚Äô capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents. Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq‚Äô commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq. In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States. In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.',\n",
       " '(h) Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security. Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States. They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees. For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses. And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.',\n",
       " '(i) Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism remains a matter of grave concern. In light of the Ninth Circuit‚Äô observation that the political branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspensions than are the courts, and in order to avoid spending additional time pursuing litigation, I am revoking Executive Order 13769 and replacing it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens.',\n",

       " \"Conspiracy Theory's Journey From Talk Radio to Oval Office\",\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON -- It began at 6 p.m. Thursday as a conspiratorial rant on conservative talk radio: President Barack Obama had used the instrumentalities of the federal government to wiretap the Republican seeking to succeed him. This is the big scandal, Mark Levin, the host, told his listeners.',\n",
       " \"By Friday morning, the unsubstantiated allegation had been picked up by Breitbart News, the site once headed by President Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Less than 24 hours later, the president embraced the conspiracy in a series of Twitter posts accusing his predecessor of spying on him, setting in motion the latest head-spinning, did-he-really-say-that furor of Mr. Trump's six-week-old presidency.\",\n",
       " 'Previous presidents usually measured their words to avoid a media feeding frenzy, but Mr. Trump showed again over the weekend that he feeds off the frenzy. Uninhibited by the traditional protocols of his office, he makes the most incendiary assertions based on shreds of suspicion. He does so without consulting some of his most senior aides, or even agencies of his own government that might have contrary information. After setting off a public firestorm with no proof, he then calls for an investigation to find the missing evidence.',\n",
       " \"To his adversaries, Mr. Trump's bomb-throwing seems like a calculated strategy to distract from another story he wants to avoid. In this case, they said Sunday, he clearly wanted to turn the conversation away from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself last week from any federal investigation into the Trump campaign's links with Russia in response to reports that he had met with Russia's ambassador during the presidential race. Instead of what Mr. Sessions did or did not do, the Sunday talk shows were dominated by discussion about what Mr. Obama did or did not do.\",\n",
       " \"But in shifting the story, Mr. Trump also kept the Russia investigation front and center, rather than his initiatives on health care, taxes or jobs. His first address to Congress, which won him plaudits for being presidential, was last week but now feels ages ago. Even some Republicans pointed out that if an eavesdropping warrant had been approved, it would mean that a judge was convinced that someone in Mr. Trump's circle might have committed a crime or acted as a foreign agent.\",\n",
       " \"I'm very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told the audience at a town hall-style meeting in his home state over the weekend. At the same time, he said, I would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with a foreign government.\",\n",
       " \"This was hardly the first time Mr. Trump made a shocking accusation without evidence. He claimed that more than three million people voted against him illegally in November, giving Hillary Clinton a victory in the popular vote. Republican and Democratic officials alike said there was no indication of any such thing, and Mr. Trump's promised investigation has so far led nowhere.\",\n",
       " 'Nor was it the first time Mr. Trump leveled astonishing allegations against Mr. Obama. He spent years promoting the false claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States, promising an investigation to uncover the truth and backing down only last year, during his campaign. And last summer, he asserted that Mr. Obama was the founder of ISIS.',\n",
       " \"The White House remained firm on Sunday even after Mr. Obama's office denied ordering a wiretap and James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, said on NBC's Meet the Press that there had been no wiretapping of Mr. Trump or his campaign. James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, privately asked the Justice Department to issue a statement that Mr. Trump's claim was false, senior officials said, but the department had not done so as of Sunday evening.\",\n",
       " \"Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said on This Week on ABC News. There are multiple news outlets that have reported this.

       " 'By Friday morning, the unsubstantiated allegation had been picked up by Breitbart News, the site once headed by President Trump‚Äô chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Less than 24 hours later, the president embraced the conspiracy in a series of Twitter posts accusing his predecessor of spying on him, setting in motion the latest head-spinning, did-he-really-say-that furor of Mr. Trump‚Äô six-week-old presidency.',\n",
       " 'Previous presidents usually measured their words to avoid a media feeding frenzy, but Mr. Trump showed again over the weekend that he feeds off the frenzy. Uninhibited by the traditional protocols of his office, he makes the most incendiary assertions based on shreds of suspicion. He does so without consulting some of his most senior aides, or even agencies of his own government that might have contrary information. After setting off a public firestorm with no proof, he then calls for an investigation to find the missing evidence.',\n",
       " 'To his adversaries, Mr. Trump‚Äô bomb-throwing seems like a calculated strategy to distract from another story he wants to avoid. In this case, they said Sunday, he clearly wanted to turn the conversation away from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself last week from any federal investigation into the Trump campaign‚Äô links with Russia in response to reports that he had met with Russia‚Äô ambassador during the presidential race. Instead of what Mr. Sessions did or did not do, the Sunday talk shows were filled with discussion about what Mr. Obama did or did not do.',\n",
       " 'But in doing so, Mr. Trump also kept the Russia story front and center, rather than his initiatives on health care, taxes or jobs. Last week, his first address to Congress, which won him plaudits for being presidential, now feels ages ago. Even some Republicans pointed out that if an eavesdropping warrant had been approved, it would mean that a judge was convinced that someone in Mr. Trump‚Äô circle might have committed a crime or acted as a foreign agent.',\n",

       " 'This was hardly the first time Mr. Trump made a shocking accusation without evidence. He claimed that more than three million people voted against him illegally in November, giving Hillary Clinton a victory in the popular vote.

       " 'Nor was it the first time Mr. Trump leveled astonishing allegations against Mr. Obama.

And last summer, he asserted that Mr. Obama was ‚Äúhe founder of ISIS.‚Äù',\n",

       " \"The Life, Legend, and Afterlife of Hollywood's Most Beloved Movie\",\n",
       " 'The Hollywood Blacklist and the Making of an American Classic',\n",
       " \"It's a strange but serendipitous coincidence that two books devoted to Hollywood classics, Casablanca and High Noon, are being published at the same time. The films, released a scant 10 years apart in 1942 and 1952 respectively, are perfect bookends, spot-on reflections of the times in which they were made, and therefore dramatically different. And in the era of the Trump presidency, these books are charged by an immediacy they otherwise might not enjoy.\",\n",
       " \"Casablanca arrived just short of a year after the United States declared war on Germany. In it, Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine, whose mantra is I stick my neck out for nobody, famously does just that, shrugging off the neutrality that had been American policy until Pearl Harbor, and helping his former flame Ingrid Bergman and the Czech resistance hero Paul Henreid escape the Nazis. The film also includes a memorably inspirational episode of collective defiance, as the refugees, con men and adventurers in Rick's place join in a rousing rendition of the Marseillaise, drowning out German officers who are singing Die Wacht am Rhein.\",\n",
       " \"High Noon, on the other hand, is a profile in collective cowardice. The United States was in the grip of the Red Scare, and the marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper), can't find a single good man in the dusty Western town of Hadleyville to help him confront the Miller brothers and their gang, who have sworn to kill him. Coop prevails, naturally, but his triumph fails to dispel the toxic fog of betrayal and disillusion that shrouds the story.\",\n",
       " \"We'll Always Have Casablanca was written by Noah Isenberg, the director of screen studies at the New School, and probably best known for a biography of Edgar G. Ulmer, a B-film director much beloved by cineastes. Here, Isenberg gives us the soup-to-nuts on Casablanca, dutifully making his way through script, casting, production and reception, to the inevitable squabbling over credit, all the while trying to account for its enduring popularity.\",\n",
       " 'Casablanca was rooted in a trip that the aspiring playwright Murray Burnett and his wife took to Vienna in the summer of 1938, just after they were married. Austria had overwhelmingly voted to serve itself up to the German Anschluss that March, and was busy implementing the notorious Nuremberg Laws. Burnett quickly discovered that it was not the best place for Jews on their honeymoon. But getting out of Vienna was considerably harder than getting in, especially since Burnett, wearing diamond rings on every finger, and his wife, wearing a fur coat in August, were smuggling out valuables belonging to relatives. When they reached the South of France, they stopped at a cafe full of refugees and army officers. Burnett said to his wife, What a setting for a play.',\n",
       " 'Burnett developed his play with his writing partner, Joan Alison, but could not get it produced. He did, however, manage to sell it to Warner Brothers, generally known for its progressive pictures, and in particular a series of anti-Nazi films like Confessions of a Nazi Spy, released in 1939, when other studios were still trying to protect their German assets.',\n",
       " \"Nobody involved with Casablanca had high expectations for the picture, although it was written by the colorful Epstein twins, Julius and Philip, and Howard Koch. The Epsteins were widely admired for their witty dialogue, on and off screen. Of the film, Julius once said, There wasn't one moment of reality in 'Casablanca.' We weren't making art. We were making a living. Nevertheless, when it was released, it became an instant hit, and won three Oscars, including best picture. It's all in Isenberg's account, and Casablanca fans will find it to be a treasure trove of facts and anecdotes.\",\n",
       " 'High Noon is a far deeper dig into the background and historical context of its subject; that is, the sorry history of the blacklist, instituted by the studios after the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) put a gun to their collective heads in 1947.',\n",
       " \"Despite the voluminous literature on the subject, surprisingly little has been written about High Noon. For many years, Billy Wilder's unfriendly words about the so-called Unfriendly Ten who refused to answer questions before HUAC -- Only two of them have talent. The rest are just unfriendly -- passed for the conventional wisdom. Even though Carl Foreman, who hatched the story and wrote the script, had more -- and better -- credits than most of his blacklisted confreres, unlike them he didn't live to finish writing his memoirs. The director, Fred Zinnemann, never made it into the film critic Andrew Sarris's famous Pantheon, and the producer, Stanley Kramer, was condescended to by intellectuals for his message movies.\",\n",
       " \"Glenn Frankel comes to his subject with a widely praised book about John Ford's The Searchers and an impressive r√©um√©n journalism, including a Pulitzer Prize. Although much of Frankel's material is familiar, the blacklist is a gift that keeps on giving. There always seems to be something new to chew on, in this case the transcripts of HUAC's secret executive sessions. Besides, it's a story that bears retelling because Hollywood, not to mention the rest of the country, is haunted by ghosts that won't go away (witness Newt Gingrich's recent call for a resurrection of HUAC, now to be wielded against ISIS, not Communists).\",\n",
       " \"At first HUAC was considered something of a joke, but as time passed, the committee's antics became more scary than risible. Like much of the Hollywood left, Humphrey Bogart supported the 19 unfriendly screenwriters initially called before the committee. He had backed Franklin Roosevelt in his 1944 presidential campaign, and when he was attacked by the right, he struck a defiant note in The Saturday Evening Post. Alluding to his role in Casablanca, he wrote, I'm going to keep right on sticking my neck out, without worrying about its possible effect upon my career. But a brief three years later, when the right turned up the heat, he published an abject apologia in Photoplay magazine entitled, I'm No Communist, in which he distanced himself from the Ten. Likewise, Jack Warner, whose studio had invented the anti-fascist genre, gave HUAC the names of 16 screenwriters, including those of the Epstein twins, of whom he said, Those boys are always on the side of the underdog. Foreman didn't intend his script to be the blacklist parable it became, but as he watched his friends fall around him, it was almost inevitable. Foreman felt like the Gary Cooper character. He regarded High Noon as a picture about conscience versus compromise.\",\n",
       " \"Surprisingly, it is Gary Cooper, a card-carrying conservative, who emerges as one of the few heroes of this story. Called before HUAC in the middle of production, Foreman gave his star the opportunity to leave the picture -- guilt by association was de rigueur in those days -- but Cooper refused. Foreman declined to name names, and Kramer fired him. In Casablanca, the so-called refugee trail led from Europe to America. During the witch hunt years, it went the other way. Moving to London, Foreman said goodbye to his country, his livelihood and, eventually, his marriage. Cooper tried to help him by buying stock in his new company, but bullied by the likes of John Wayne and Hedda Hopper, he eventually pulled out, albeit cordially. If Foreman had thought that art was imitating life in High Noon, once Cooper caved it seemed clear that at least in his life, unlike Marshal Will Kane's, there were no happy endings.\",\n",
       " 'Frankel narrates this story well. He has a sure ear for the telling anecdote, and a good eye for detail. (Parnell Thomas chaired the HUAC hearings sitting on a phone book covered by a red cushion to compensate for his diminutive stature.) The era has been labeled the plague years, but Frankel is forgiving of those caught up in its tangle of principle and expediency, courage and cowardice. He adopts the verdict of Dalton Trumbo, another of the Unfriendly Ten: There were only victims.',\n",
       " 'Correction: March 19, 2017, Sunday',\n",
       " \"This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A review on March 5 about Noah Isenberg's We'll Always Have Casablanca and Glenn Frankel's High Noon misstated the constitutional amendment under which the so-called Unfriendly Ten refused to answer questions before the House Un-American Activities Committee during its investigation of the Hollywood film industry in 1947. The 10 maintained that they were entitled to remain silent under the terms of the First Amendment, not the Fifth.

       " \"The change is at the heart of a re-engineering of the National Security Council's role under its new leader, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and reflects Mr. Trump's belief that the N.S.C. should focus less on military operations and tactics and more on strategic issues. A guiding precept for the president and his team is that the balance of power in the world has shifted against American interests, and that General McMaster should focus on developing foreign and economic policy options in concert with the Pentagon, State Department and other agencies to respond to that challenge.\",\n",
       " 'The new approach to managing military operations was evident this month when a Marine artillery battery and a team of Army Rangers -- some 400 troops in all -- arrived in northern Syria.

       " 'The benefit is that it allows the military campaign to go forward without undue pauses, interruptions or delays, Ms. Flournoy added. That enables it to create more momentum and to be more responsive to changes on the battlefield. But there is a risk if there is inadequate oversight and the president stops playing close attention. It can be detrimental, even dangerous, if a commander in chief does not feel ownership of the campaign or loses touch with how things are evolving on the ground.',\n",

       " \"Politics is something like an art, if you ask those who practice it, and it's something like a science, if you ask those who study it. But to the journalists who cover it, it has always been something like something else: a sport. Writing in 1968, Milton Rokeach, the social psychologist, articulated what would become a perennial complaint. The kinds of data obtained by public-opinion research and disseminated in the mass media seem designed more to entertain than to inform, he wrote. The quality of the information conveyed seems not much different from that conveyed in the sports pages or, better yet, the daily racing form. The press, especially during election years, frequently failed to exercise journalistic conscience; it had internalized a racehorse philosophy.\",\n",
       " \"Nearly half a century later, Rokeach's assessment still echoes in our gripes about political news. His chosen metaphor, however, has been beaten to death. Coverage is now turning away from a language of sports and toward a language of war. The horse race has given way to an arms race, in which everything, and everyone, have the potential to be weaponized.\",\n",
       " \"According to the past year in headlines, Donald Trump has amassed a particularly enormous arsenal. Since the beginning of the election, he has been credited with improvising (or trying to improvise) weapons out of everything within reach: Twitter, the dollar, conspiracy theories, fake news, harassment, Bill Clinton, emails, the media, merry Christmas, federal funding, unintelligibility and chaos -- to name just a few. Trump's opponents have taken up arms, too. Among the weaponry: Hillary Clinton's popular-vote victory, history, social media, protest and Trump's incendiary anti-Muslim election rhetoric (which was weaponized in court arguments against the travel restrictions he ordered). The left has been accused of weaponizing political correctness, weaponizing safe spaces and weaponizing racism -- meaning accusations of racial hatred, not racial hatred itself.\",\n",
       " \"Weaponization works as a throwing up of the hands, and as a suggestion -- or an admission, or a strategic claim -- that the discourse has failed us. Or, more accurately, it suggests that the discourse has become something dangerous: no mere fight but a terminal conflict without decorum or limits. The language of sports had a maddening tendency to flatten and trivialize the serious consequences of politics, creating constant suspense but obscuring life-or-death stakes. Militarized language moves in a different direction: It intensifies the news it's describing while simultaneously obscuring actual threats. Weaponization is used to describe both rhetoric that might incite violence and criticism of violent rhetoric. It is lodged against the state, with its legal monopoly on violence, but also, incoherently, against those who challenge the state. It is a shortcut to false equivalence, and it manufactures excuses for those with a vested interest in drawing blood themselves.\",\n",
       " 'As a metaphor, weaponization creates paranoia and the impression that nothing is immune from conscription. Suddenly tools for violence are hiding everywhere, waiting to be brandished by your enemies, taken up for self-defense or fatally mishandled by the blind or na√Øe. The fabric of civilian life is now wrapped in a linguistic fog of war.',\n",
       " \"Weaponize was born in the 1950s as military jargon. It was an instantly comprehensible neologism, useful and compact and inflected with the managerial style then in vogue. To turn into a weapon sounds clumsy and crude, bringing to mind early man gripping a fist-size rock or a prisoner sharpening a toothbrush. Weaponize, on the other hand, conjures thick-rimmed glasses and pomade, official reports and secret plans. It's a contemporary of collateral damage, another term emblematic of what had not yet been termed the military-industrial complex.\",\n",
       " \"Its first documented appearance in front of a wide audience came in 1957, in an Associated Press interview with Wernher von Braun, the former Nazi engineer who would become an integral figure in the American space program. Von Braun explained to the unnamed reporter that his work had been to weaponize the military's ballistic-missile technology. Army rocketry was, of course, always destined for war, so von Braun's use of the word suggested the fulfillment of a plan, more than a conversion. Over the decades that followed, weaponization proliferated alongside nuclear warheads, describing their constantly multiplying delivery systems, and lingered through the late stages of the Cold War. But it has periodically re-entered the lexicon to address fresh fears: anxiety about new infectious diseases being put to sinister ends; weapons of mass destruction, during the run-up to the first and second American wars in Iraq; and of course, 21st-century terror attacks, in which horrifying and surprising things -- passenger planes, trucks -- were converted into instruments of slaughter.\",\n",
       " \"Recently, as the word has crept into civilian life to describe an anxiety about the future, it has brought uncanny echoes of history along with it. In that 1957 interview, von Braun used the word in response to a question about the Soviet Union's technological advantages. Today it is Russia that is described -- by American intelligence figures -- as leading the way in a very different form of cutting-edge weaponization: of hackers, leaks, data dumps, social media and information in general, all aided by the machinery of the internet. This rhetorical conversion of the entire internet into a field of battle dovetails neatly with our deepening fears about technology and privacy. The notion that a state could weaponize social media for political ends is easy to understand in the familiar terms of online harassment, which turns seemingly inert platforms like Twitter or Facebook into tools for invading privacy and inflicting fear. Similarly, a nation using malware to interfere with a rival power's missile launches resembles, more than superficially, a hacker's plot to conscript your wireless baby monitor into a malicious botnet, and worries about pervasive state surveillance bring to mind our ambivalent relationships with the online services to which we hand over our most personal information. Both lines of thinking look at our technological, social and political acceleration with an extreme but appealingly simple pessimism: Whatever this is, it ends badly.\",\n",
       " \"This feeling can breed either cynicism or paranoia, calling into question not just different claims about the world but also the tools used to make them. Weaponized Narrative Is the New Battlespace, blared a January headline on Defense One, a website that covers national-security news. Weaponized narrative seeks to undermine an opponent's civilization, identity and will by generating complexity, confusion and political and social schisms, the article says, repeating the claim that Russia controlled the United States presidential election with disinformation and hacked data. The global rise of blood-and-soil nationalism, it suggests, is a result of attacks meant to tear down old identities that have bound us together.\",\n",
       " \"Russia Insider, a website broadly defensive of the country's government, treated the subject with mockery. The Western media, it wrote in March of last year, was sounding paranoid: Whatever You Can Think Of, Russia Is 'Weaponizing' It. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks -- another entity frequently accused of weaponizing information -- returned the favor in February: When you read a newspaper article, you are reading weaponized text.\",\n",
       " \"In the months since the election, as our linguistic arms race has continued to escalate, less metaphorical weapons have inauspiciously rejoined the discourse: consumer drones in Mosul, the VX nerve agent in a Malaysian airport and, in North Korea, the original weaponized weapons, ballistic missiles. Seeing these headlines side by side with articles about the weaponization of data (to win elections) and of Hollywood (to criticize the president) doesn't feel as strange as you might expect. Of course quadcopter drones have been weaponized. We're at war. Haven't you heard? They're weaponizing tweets now.\",\n",
       " 'But even as a metaphor, far away from missiles and drones and nerve agents, weaponization is disorienting. That social media can be described within a single year as having been weaponized by Barack Obama and by ISIS, by and against Hillary Clinton, by governments and by brands, by Donald Trump and by the protesters challenging him, by bots and marketers and malicious trolls targeting other users with explicitly violent threats -- all of this is a testament to how weaponization scrambles power in ways that tend to favor the actually violent. It places weapons in the hands of everyone around them, annexing their targets into a war zone where anything is permissible.',\n",

The list went on.',\n",

       " \"The State Department dismissed criticism of Mr. Tillerson's absence, which came even from some Republicans. But for observers of American foreign policy, it was hard not to interpret the low-key rollout as another step by the Trump administration away from America's traditional role as a moral authority on the world stage that tries to shape and promote democratic norms, both for their intrinsic value and to create a more secure world.\",\n",
       " 'Interviews with more than a dozen former diplomats, professors, human rights advocates and international politicians, both abroad and in the United States, suggested that the United States under President Trump was poised to cede not only this global role, but also its ability to lead by example.',\n",
       " \"Many pointed out that America's own actions over the years have already eroded its moral standing -- Guant√°amo Bay, the use of torture on suspected terrorists and the civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan, to name a few.\",\n",
       " \"But Mr. Trump's administration stands alone, many experts said, for the divisiveness of its tone toward minorities and the media at home and toward Muslims and migrants abroad, its disparagement of NATO and the European Union and its praise of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which have blurred distinctions between allies and enemies.\",\n",
       " \"Mr. Trump himself recently put the United States on the same moral plane as Russia, when the Fox News talk show host Bill O'Reilly protested during an interview that Mr. Putin was a killer.\",\n",
       " \"There are a lot of killers, Mr. Trump quickly responded. We've got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country's so innocent?\",\n",
       " 'The comment alarmed many because it underscored an approach by Mr. Trump, like the rejection of migrants from certain predominantly Muslim countries, that has stripped much of the moral component from American foreign relations and left him being lectured by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and others about his duties under international law.',\n",
       " 'Her foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, has gone one step further, reminding America of its moral duty as the most powerful Western country and one founded by Christian refugees.',\n",
       " 'The United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people, he said recently. This is what unites us in the West and this is what we want to make clear to the Americans.',\n",
       " 'Behind the rhetoric is the idea that moral authority -- as amorphous and idealistic as that can sound -- has imbued America with a special kind of clout in the world, with a power that is different from that wielded by autocrats and dictators or by big countries like Russia and China.',\n",
       " 'While the Soviet-era dominance across Eastern Europe undoubtedly was undermined by an expensive Cold War arms race with the United States, it was the Western Democratic system and America that many people looked to emulate, former diplomats said.',\n",
       " \"The Berlin Wall didn't come down because people were responding to American howitzers, said Joseph Nye, a former senior State Department official and now a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. It came down under hammers and bulldozers wielded by people whose minds had been affected by the ideas of the West.\",\n",

       " \"As for the new executive order, he added, this administration isn't ignoring the plight of refugees or discouraging people from visiting the U.S. It is simply making the security of the American people its No. 1 priority and instituting a temporary pause so that we can evaluate and ensure our vetting processes are as strong as they can possibly be. In short, American diplomacy plays an important role in American security, a security which promotes our prosperity.\",\n",
       " \"Not all are so convinced. Though in its early stages, Mr. Trump's presidency has for many called into question what kind of role America aims to play in the world, and even whether it wants to remain an example for other countries. Abandoning that role will have consequences, some are warning.\",\n",
       " 'If America no longer presents an image of religious tolerance -- a core component of its moral standing -- it undermines its ability to make needed alliances, several diplomats said.',\n",

       " 'For Hoshyar Zebari, a former foreign minister of Iraq, the initial decision to issue the migrant ban and include Iraq was utterly puzzling as well as deeply unfair, given how many Iraqis had fought on the same side as the Americans against the Islamic State and its precursors in Iraq.',\n",
       " \"Mr. Trump does seem to have been convinced of the importance of Iraq's role in the fight against Islamic extremism, and the latest version of his immigration ban includes six predominantly Muslim countries, leaving Iraq off the list. Still, the anti-Muslim rhetoric has emboldened extremists that this is the true face of America, Mr. Zebari said.\",\n",
       " \"Some of the policies Mr. Trump seems eager to pursue may also compromise America's ability to lecture China about more tolerance toward Tibetan Buddhists or Uighurs, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about a free news media or tolerance of the Kurds, they noted.\",\n",
       " \"Not everyone agrees that Mr. Trump's approach is a startling departure from America's values, however.\",\n",
       " \"Hubert V√©rine, a former French foreign minister, noted that while Barack Obama may have been more elegant and refined in his words, he pursued many policies similar to Mr. Trump's, like urging NATO members to do more.\",\n",
       " \"One cannot describe the international system before Trump as working very well, Mr. V√©rine said. It's not as though it was a paradisiacal, idyllic world, and abruptly Trump appeared like some kind of Attila.\",\n",
       " 'Yet the idea of a moral component in American identity dates back to the pilgrims. The notion became a particularly strong principle in foreign policy after World War I, with the United States playing a leading role in the creation of global organizations.',\n",
       " \"That moral strand was strengthened by World War II, not only because of America's part in helping to vanquish the Nazis, but also its postwar efforts to help rebuild Europe and form the United Nations.\",\n",
       " 'Now, as America looks at minimizing its commitments to NATO and the European Union, there is the sense that it can no longer be counted on as a reliable partner.',\n",
       " \"The most burning question overseas is, 'Can we rely on the United States to keep its commitments, can we rely on you to lead in the way we expect, are you going to consider the interests of your allies when new deals are made?' said Mich√®e Flournoy, the former under secretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration.\",\n",

       " 'Among them are members of the Zahab family. Now one of them, Haisem Zahab, a 42-year-old electrician, is accused of using the internet to try to help the Islamic State develop a guided missile. Officials suspect that some of his relatives traveled to Syria to join the extremist group, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.',\n",
       " 'The allegations about the Zahab family have rattled many residents of this town, who have long taken pride in its peaceful multiculturalism. They have also stoked some of the worst fears about homegrown links to terrorism in a country that is grappling with immigration policy and labor shortages.',\n",

The other point put forward is that hatred is not the way to handle this situation and one man's actions should not condemn the entire town's Muslim population.\",\n",

Trump to the American presidency and that prompted voters in Britain to approve a withdrawal from the European Union.

       " 'Family members had access to a significant amount of funds in an Australian bank account and were suspected of using international travel cards and a computer consulting company based in the Middle East to remit funds out of Australia for the use and benefit of Islamic State in Syria, the report said, adding that members of the family were believed to have already traveled to Syria to become members of the terrorist group.',\n",
       " \"Mr. Zahab was charged with foreign incursion offenses, which are antiterrorism statutes that carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. After Mr. Zahab's arrest, police officers spent days searching his 10-acre property, using metal detectors and digging up the yard in search of evidence.\",\n",
       " 'Mr. Zahab is no stranger to law enforcement, having pleaded guilty previously to drugs and firearms charges. He is linked to a business called Oz Survival Gear, which is registered to the address that was raided by the police. The company sells items such as Swiss Army knives and flashlights, and it proclaims that a knifeless man is a lifeless man.',\n",

The group's fighters are expected to fight on in Deir al-Zour, a Syrian province south of Raqqa, and in Iraqi towns along the Euphrates River, as well as to try to administer their self-proclaimed caliphate from those places.\",\n",
       " 'A detailed assessment of Islamic State fighting capabilities was provided by the American defense official, who could not be identified under the ground rules for the Pentagon briefing.',\n",
       " 'The overall picture the official painted of the Islamic State was of an organization losing significant amounts of territory but still determined to fight. All told, the militant group is estimated to have at least 15,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria, although its flow of volunteers has shrunk to 100 a month or even fewer.',\n",
       " 'No more than 2,500 fighters are struggling to defend western Mosul and the nearby town of Tal Afar, where they are largely cut off by Iraqi forces from receiving supplies and reinforcements. Those fighters have used crude chemical weapons, including chlorine and low-grade sulfur mustard. But while the weapons have hurt civilians, American officials do not believe that they have been militarily effective.',\n",

       " \"Still, the official acknowledged, the Islamic State has the resources to carry on, including an abundant supply of weapons and cash that it stole from the Iraqi and Syrian authorities when the militant group swept across the countries in 2014. The resilience of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group's leader, may also be a rallying factor. The American defense official said he was believed to be alive and to have left Mosul.\",\n",
       " \"American officials appear confident that the Islamic State will be evicted from Iraq's major cities and towns within six months. One militant stronghold that the Iraqi government has yet to focus on is Hawija, west of Kirkuk. Iraqi troops bypassed the town, where the defense official said the Islamic State has as many as 1,000 fighters, in the rush to reach Mosul. In October, the militant group used the Hawija area as a springboard for a counterattack on Kirkuk, which was put down after a couple of days of bitter fighting.\",\n",

       " 'Far from abandoning their dream of a caliphate, Islamic State leaders appear to be making arrangements so that if Raqqa falls, some administrative functions can continue to be carried out in their remaining territory, which the group controls with an iron fist.',\n",
       " 'The Trump administration has yet to make clear whether it will arm Syrian Kurds for the fight to take Raqqa. Turkey objects to the prospect of assisting the Kurdish minority that straddles the border between the two countries. Another crucial decision is which Syrian groups will govern and secure the city once it is retaken.',\n",

       " 'PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES',\n",
       " 'By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the Nation from terrorist activities by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:',\n",
       " 'Section 1. Policy and Purpose. (a) It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.',\n",
       " '(b) On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).',\n",
       " '(i) Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States. Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security: (I) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists. 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.',\n",
       " '(ii) In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries -- each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States -- would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.',\n",
       " '(iii) Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.',\n",
       " '(iv) Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities -- whoever they are and wherever they reside -- to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.',\n",
       " '(c) The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States. On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions about who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.',\n",
       " \"(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats. Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones. Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government's willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States. Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.\",\n",
       " \"(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:\",\n",
       " \"(i) Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa'ida and has permitted al-Qa'ida to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.\",\n",
       " \"(ii) Libya. Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals. In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions. Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.\",\n",
       " \"(iii) Somalia. Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa'ida-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.\",\n",
       " \"(iv) Sudan. Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas. Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa'ida and other terrorist groups to meet and train. Although Sudan's support to al-Qa'ida has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa'ida and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.\",\n",
       " \"(v) Syria. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country. At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq. ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States. The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012. Syria does not cooperate with the United States' counterterrorism efforts.\",\n",
       " \"(vi) Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks. Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen's porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities. In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country. Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.\",\n",
       " '(f) In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.',\n",
       " \"(g) Iraq presents a special case. Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq. Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government's capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents. Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq's commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq. In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States. In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.\",\n",
       " '(h) Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security. Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States. They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees. For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses. And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.',\n",
       " \"(i) Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism remains a matter of grave concern. In light of the Ninth Circuit's observation that the political branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspensions than are the courts, and in order to avoid spending additional time pursuing litigation, I am revoking Executive Order 13769 and replacing it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens.\",\n",
       " 'Sec. 2. Temporary Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern During Review Period. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat. The Secretary of Homeland Security may conclude that certain information is needed from particular countries even if it is not needed from every country.',\n",

The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence.\",\n",
       " '(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening and vetting of foreign nationals, to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists, and in light of the national security concerns referenced in section 1 of this order, I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the unrestricted entry into the United States of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore direct that the entry into the United States of nationals of those six countries be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of this order, subject to the limitations, waivers, and exceptions set forth in sections 3 and 12 of this order.',\n",
       " '(d) Upon submission of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed from each country for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request that all foreign governments that do not supply such information regarding their nationals begin providing it within 50 days of notification.',\n",

       " 'PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES',\n",
       " 'By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the Nation from terrorist activities by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:',\n",
       " 'Section 1. Policy and Purpose. (a) It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.',\n",
       " '(b) On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).',\n",
       " '(i) Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States. Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security: ‚ÄúI) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists.‚Äù U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.',\n",
       " '(ii) In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part: ‚Äúhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.‚Äù U.S.C. 1182(f). Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries ‚Äîach afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States ‚Äîould be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.',\n",
       " '(iii) Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.',\n",
       " '(iv) Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities ‚Äîhoever they are and wherever they reside ‚Äîo avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.',\n",
       " '(c) The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States. On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the ‚Äúolitical branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions‚Äùbout who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.',\n",
       " '(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats. Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones. Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government‚Äô willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States. Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.',\n",
       " '(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State‚Äô Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:',\n",
       " '(i) Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa‚Äôda and has permitted al-Qa‚Äôda to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.',\n",
       " '(ii) Libya. Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals. In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions. Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States‚Äôounterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.',\n",
       " '(iii) Somalia. Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa‚Äôda-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.',\n",
       " '(iv) Sudan. Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas. Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa‚Äôda and other terrorist groups to meet and train. Although Sudan‚Äô support to al-Qa‚Äôda has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States‚Äôounterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa‚Äôda and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.',\n",
       " '(v) Syria. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country. At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq. ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States. The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012. Syria does not cooperate with the United States‚Äôounterterrorism efforts.',\n",
       " '(vi) Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa‚Äôda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks. Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen‚Äô porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities. In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country. Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.',\n",
       " '(f) In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.',\n",
       " '(g) Iraq presents a special case. Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq. Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government‚Äô capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents. Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq‚Äô commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq. In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States. In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.',\n",
       " '(h) Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security. Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States. They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees. For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses. And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon.

       " 'WASHINGTON -- It began at 6 p.m. Thursday as a conspiratorial rant on conservative talk radio: President Barack Obama had used the instrumentalities of the federal government to wiretap the Republican seeking to succeed him. This is the big scandal, Mark Levin, the host, told his listeners.',\n",
       " \"By Friday morning, the unsubstantiated allegation had been picked up by Breitbart News, the site once headed by President Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Less than 24 hours later, the president embraced the conspiracy in a series of Twitter posts accusing his predecessor of spying on him, setting in motion the latest head-spinning, did-he-really-say-that furor of Mr. Trump's six-week-old presidency.\",\n",
       " 'Previous presidents usually measured their words to avoid a media feeding frenzy, but Mr. Trump showed again over the weekend that he feeds off the frenzy. Uninhibited by the traditional protocols of his office, he makes the most incendiary assertions based on shreds of suspicion. He does so without consulting some of his most senior aides, or even agencies of his own government that might have contrary information. After setting off a public firestorm with no proof, he then calls for an investigation to find the missing evidence.',\n",
       " \"To his adversaries, Mr. Trump's bomb-throwing seems like a calculated strategy to distract from another story he wants to avoid. In this case, they said Sunday, he clearly wanted to turn the conversation away from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself last week from any federal investigation into the Trump campaign's links with Russia in response to reports that he had met with Russia's ambassador during the presidential race. Instead of what Mr. Sessions did or did not do, the Sunday talk shows were dominated by discussion about what Mr. Obama did or did not do.\",\n",
       " \"But in shifting the story, Mr. Trump also kept the Russia investigation front and center, rather than his initiatives on health care, taxes or jobs. His first address to Congress, which won him plaudits for being presidential, was last week but now feels ages ago. Even some Republicans pointed out that if an eavesdropping warrant had been approved, it would mean that a judge was convinced that someone in Mr. Trump's circle might have committed a crime or acted as a foreign agent.\",\n",
       " \"I'm very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told the audience at a town hall-style meeting in his home state over the weekend. At the same time, he said, I would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with a foreign government.\",\n",
       " \"This was hardly the first time Mr. Trump made a shocking accusation without evidence. He claimed that more than three million people voted against him illegally in November, giving Hillary Clinton a victory in the popular vote. Republican and Democratic officials alike said there was no indication of any such thing, and Mr. Trump's promised investigation has so far led nowhere.\",\n",
       " 'Nor was it the first time Mr. Trump leveled astonishing allegations against Mr. Obama. He spent years promoting the false claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States, promising an investigation to uncover the truth and backing down only last year, during his campaign. And last summer, he asserted that Mr. Obama was the founder of ISIS.',\n",
       " \"The White House remained firm on Sunday even after Mr. Obama's office denied ordering a wiretap and James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, said on NBC's Meet the Press that there had been no wiretapping of Mr. Trump or his campaign. James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, privately asked the Justice Department to issue a statement that Mr. Trump's claim was false, senior officials said, but the department had not done so as of Sunday evening.\",\n",
       " \"Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said on This Week on ABC News. There are multiple news outlets that have reported this. And all we're asking is that we get the same level of look into the Obama administration and the potential that they had for a complete abuse of power that they've been claiming that we have done over the last six months.\",\n",
       " 'Ms. Sanders pointed to reports in multiple outlets, including The New York Times, as the foundation for the allegation. Mr. Levin, the radio host, likewise read from a series of mainstream news reports during an appearance on Fox & Friends on Sunday.',\n",
       " \"The evidence is overwhelming, he said. This is not about President Trump's tweeting. This is about the Obama administration's spying, and the question isn't whether it spied. He added, The question is who they did spy on, the extent of the spying -- that is, the Trump campaign, the Trump transition, Trump surrogates.\",\n",
       " \"But the news organizations he and Ms. Sanders cited have not reported that Mr. Obama tapped Mr. Trump's phones, as the president claimed on Twitter. The Times has reported that several of Mr. Trump's associates are being investigated for their connections with Russians and that law enforcement agencies have examined intercepted communications. It has not reported that those associates themselves have necessarily been wiretapped, but it has reported surveillance of Russians, which is commonplace.\",\n",
       " \"News outlets have noted that a phone call between Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump's first national security adviser, and Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, was monitored, leading to Mr. Flynn's resignation because his account of the conversation did not match the intercept. It is common for the United States to monitor the communications of Russia's ambassador.\",\n",
       " 'The Times also reported that before leaving office, Obama officials tried to spread information about Russian meddling in the election and possible links between Russia and Trump associates, in order to leave a trail for government investigators.',\n",
       " \"Some Republicans suggested that Mr. Trump might have extrapolated that into an unfounded assertion. I think the president was not correct, certainly, in saying that President Obama ordered a tap on a server in Trump Tower, former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey said on This Week. However, I think he's right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney -- of the Justice Department, through the special court that authorizes eavesdropping on suspected foreign agents inside the United States.\",\n",
       " \"Conservative radio hosts like Mr. Levin and Rush Limbaugh have focused on Mr. Obama's tactics for a while. But it was not until Breitbart published its story that the specific claims crossed Mr. Trump's desk.\",\n",
       " \"Mr. Trump's aides -- including Mr. Bannon, an anti-establishment figure who has long questioned the motives of parts of the extensive intelligence bureaucracy -- have believed for a long time that the Obama administration colluded with federal investigators who were searching for activity between Russian officials and the Trump campaign surrounding the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails.\",\n",
       " 'They have never offered evidence, but Mr. Trump has long dabbled in conspiracy theories. So when Mr. Trump became aware of the claims in the Breitbart article, aides said, they were appealing to him. It was not immediately clear if someone printed the article out for him or if it was part of a collection of Twitter posts and news articles that his aides present to him each day. But it resonated.',\n",
       " 'Aides say Mr. Trump went into Friday in a foul mood. He had not known ahead of time that Mr. Sessions planned to recuse himself and never thought he should, even after Mr. Sessions acknowledged that he had talked to Mr. Kislyak despite suggesting otherwise in his Senate confirmation hearing.',\n",
       " \"Mr. Trump told some advisers that he thought Mr. Sessions had fumbled his answer at that hearing. But on Friday morning in an angry session in the Oval Office, the president railed at aides about the recusal, singling out the White House counsel's office and the communications staff in a tirade visible through the window to a nearby television camera.\",\n",
       " \"Still upset after arriving at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump woke up Saturday morning and began posting on Twitter at 6:26 a.m. In a burst of six messages, he tried to turn the tables by noting that members of the Obama administration also met with Russia's ambassador.

This ‚Äús the big scandal,‚Äùark Levin, the host, told his listeners.',\n",
       " 'By Friday morning, the unsubstantiated allegation had been picked up by Breitbart News, the site once headed by President Trump‚Äô chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Less than 24 hours later, the president embraced the conspiracy in a series of Twitter posts accusing his predecessor of spying on him, setting in motion the latest head-spinning, did-he-really-say-that furor of Mr. Trump‚Äô six-week-old presidency.',\n",
       " 'Previous presidents usually measured their words to avoid a media feeding frenzy, but Mr. Trump showed again over the weekend that he feeds off the frenzy. Uninhibited by the traditional protocols of his office, he makes the most incendiary assertions based on shreds of suspicion. He does so without consulting some of his most senior aides, or even agencies of his own government that might have contrary information. After setting off a public firestorm with no proof, he then calls for an investigation to find the missing evidence.',\n",
       " 'To his adversaries, Mr. Trump‚Äô bomb-throwing seems like a calculated strategy to distract from another story he wants to avoid. In this case, they said Sunday, he clearly wanted to turn the conversation away from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself last week from any federal investigation into the Trump campaign‚Äô links with Russia in response to reports that he had met with Russia‚Äô ambassador during the presidential race. Instead of what Mr. Sessions did or did not do, the Sunday talk shows were filled with discussion about what Mr. Obama did or did not do.',\n",
       " 'But in doing so, Mr. Trump also kept the Russia story front and center, rather than his initiatives on health care, taxes or jobs. Last week, his first address to Congress, which won him plaudits for being presidential, now feels ages ago. Even some Republicans pointed out that if an eavesdropping warrant had been approved, it would mean that a judge was convinced that someone in Mr. Trump‚Äô circle might have committed a crime or acted as a foreign agent.',\n",
       " '‚Äú‚Äô very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally,‚Äùenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told the audience at a town hall-style meeting in his home state over the weekend. At the same time, he said, ‚Äú would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with a foreign government.‚Äù',\n",
       " 'This was hardly the first time Mr. Trump made a shocking accusation without evidence. He claimed that more than three million people voted against him illegally in November, giving Hillary Clinton a victory in the popular vote. Republican and Democratic officials alike said there was no indication of any such thing, and Mr. Trump‚Äô promised investigation has so far led nowhere.',\n",
       " 'Nor was it the first time Mr. Trump leveled astonishing allegations against Mr. Obama. He spent years asserting that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States, promising an investigation to uncover the truth and backing down only last year, during his campaign. And last summer, he asserted that Mr. Obama was ‚Äúhe founder of ISIS.‚Äù',\n",
       " 'The White House remained firm on Sunday even after Mr. Obama‚Äô office denied ordering a wiretap and James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, said there had been no wiretapping of Mr. Trump or his campaign. James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, privately asked the Justice Department to issue a statement that Mr. Trump‚Äô claim was false, senior officials said, but the department had not done so as of Sunday evening.',\n",
       " '‚Äúverybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there,‚Äùarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said on ‚Äúhis Week‚Äù on ABC News. ‚Äúhere are multiple news outlets that have reported this. And all we‚Äôe asking is that we get the same level of look into the Obama administration and the potential that they had for a complete abuse of power that they‚Äôe been claiming that we have done over the last six months.‚Äù',\n",
       " 'Ms. Sanders pointed to reports in ‚Äúultiple outlets,‚Äùncluding The New York Times, as the foundation for the allegation. Mr. Levin, the radio host, likewise read from a series of mainstream news reports during an appearance on ‚Äúox & Friends‚Äùn Sunday.',\n",
       " '‚Äúhe evidence is overwhelming,‚Äùe said. ‚Äúhis is not about President Trump‚Äô tweeting. This is about the Obama administration‚Äô spying, and the question isn‚Äô whether it spied.‚Äùe added, ‚Äúhe question is who they did spy on, the extent of the spying ‚Äîhat is, the Trump campaign, the Trump transition, Trump surrogates.‚Äù',\n",
       " 'But the news organizations he and Ms. Sanders cited have not reported that Mr. Obama tapped Mr. Trump‚Äô phones, as the president claimed on Twitter. The Times has reported that several of Mr. Trump‚Äô associates are being investigated for their connections with Russians and that law enforcement agencies have examined intercepted communications. It has not reported that those associates themselves have necessarily been wiretapped, but it has reported surveillance of Russians, which is commonplace.',\n",
       " 'News outlets have noted that a phone call between Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump‚Äô first national security adviser, and Russia‚Äô ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, was monitored, leading to Mr. Flynn‚Äô resignation because his account of the conversation did not match the intercept. It is common for the United States to monitor the communications of Russia‚Äô ambassador.',\n",
       " 'The Times also reported that before leaving office, Obama officials tried to spread information about Russian meddling in the election and possible links between Russia and Trump associates, in order to leave a trail for government investigators.',\n",
       " 'Some Republicans said Mr. Trump might have extrapolated that into an unfounded assertion. ‚Äú think the president was not correct, certainly, in saying that President Obama ordered a tap on a server in Trump Tower,‚Äùormer Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey said on ‚Äúhis Week.‚Äù‚Äúowever, I think he‚Äô right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney ‚Äîf the Justice Department, through the FISA court,‚Äùhich authorizes eavesdropping on suspected foreign agents inside the United States.',\n",
       " 'Conservative radio hosts like Mr. Levin and Rush Limbaugh have focused on Mr. Obama‚Äô ‚Äúactics‚Äùor a while. But it was not until Breitbart published its story that the notion crossed Mr. Trump‚Äô desk. Mr. Trump‚Äô aides have believed for a long time that the Obama administration colluded with federal investigators who were searching for activity between Russian officials and the Trump campaign surrounding the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails.',\n",
       " 'They have never offered evidence, but Mr. Trump has long dabbled in conspiracy theories. So when Mr. Trump became aware of the claims in the Breitbart article, aides said, they were appealing to him. It was not immediately clear if someone printed the article out for him or if it was part of a collection of Twitter posts and news articles that his aides present to him each day. But it resonated.',\n",
       " 'Aides say Mr. Trump went into Friday in a foul mood. He had not known ahead of time that Mr. Sessions planned to recuse himself and never thought he should have, even after Mr. Sessions acknowledged that he had talked with Mr. Kislyak despite suggesting otherwise in his Senate confirmation hearing.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Trump told some advisers that he thought Mr. Sessions had fumbled his answer at that hearing. But on Friday morning in an angry session in the Oval Office, the president railed at aides about the recusal, singling out the White House counsel‚Äô office and the communications staff in a tirade visible through the window to a nearby television camera.',\n",
       " 'Still upset after arriving at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump woke up Saturday morning and began tweeting at 6:26 a.m. In a burst of six messages, he tried to turn the tables by noting that members of the Obama administration also met with Russia‚Äô ambassador.

       " \"The Life, Legend, and Afterlife of Hollywood's Most Beloved Movie\",\n",
       " 'The Hollywood Blacklist and the Making of an American Classic',\n",
       " \"It's a strange but serendipitous coincidence that two books devoted to Hollywood classics, Casablanca and High Noon, are being published at the same time. The films, released a scant 10 years apart in 1942 and 1952 respectively, are perfect bookends, spot-on reflections of the times in which they were made, and therefore dramatically different. And in the era of the Trump presidency, these books are charged by an immediacy they otherwise might not enjoy.\",\n",
       " \"Casablanca arrived just short of a year after the United States declared war on Germany. In it, Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine, whose mantra is I stick my neck out for nobody, famously does just that, shrugging off the neutrality that had been American policy until Pearl Harbor, and helping his former flame Ingrid Bergman and the Czech resistance hero Paul Henreid escape the Nazis. The film also includes a memorably inspirational episode of collective defiance, as the refugees, con men and adventurers in Rick's place join in a rousing rendition of the Marseillaise, drowning out German officers who are singing Die Wacht am Rhein.\",\n",
       " \"High Noon, on the other hand, is a profile in collective cowardice. The United States was in the grip of the Red Scare, and the marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper), can't find a single good man in the dusty Western town of Hadleyville to help him confront the Miller brothers and their gang, who have sworn to kill him. Coop prevails, naturally, but his triumph fails to dispel the toxic fog of betrayal and disillusion that shrouds the story.\",\n",
       " \"We'll Always Have Casablanca was written by Noah Isenberg, the director of screen studies at the New School, and probably best known for a biography of Edgar G. Ulmer, a B-film director much beloved by cineastes. Here, Isenberg gives us the soup-to-nuts on Casablanca, dutifully making his way through script, casting, production and reception, to the inevitable squabbling over credit, all the while trying to account for its enduring popularity.\",\n",
       " 'Casablanca was rooted in a trip that the aspiring playwright Murray Burnett and his wife took to Vienna in the summer of 1938, just after they were married. Austria had overwhelmingly voted to serve itself up to the German Anschluss that March, and was busy implementing the notorious Nuremberg Laws. Burnett quickly discovered that it was not the best place for Jews on their honeymoon. But getting out of Vienna was considerably harder than getting in, especially since Burnett, wearing diamond rings on every finger, and his wife, wearing a fur coat in August, were smuggling out valuables belonging to relatives. When they reached the South of France, they stopped at a cafe full of refugees and army officers. Burnett said to his wife, What a setting for a play.',\n",
       " 'Burnett developed his play with his writing partner, Joan Alison, but could not get it produced. He did, however, manage to sell it to Warner Brothers, generally known for its progressive pictures, and in particular a series of anti-Nazi films like Confessions of a Nazi Spy, released in 1939, when other studios were still trying to protect their German assets.',\n",
       " \"Nobody involved with Casablanca had high expectations for the picture, although it was written by the colorful Epstein twins, Julius and Philip, and Howard Koch. The Epsteins were widely admired for their witty dialogue, on and off screen. Of the film, Julius once said, There wasn't one moment of reality in 'Casablanca.' We weren't making art. We were making a living. Nevertheless, when it was released, it became an instant hit, and won three Oscars, including best picture. It's all in Isenberg's account, and Casablanca fans will find it to be a treasure trove of facts and anecdotes.\",\n",
       " 'High Noon is a far deeper dig into the background and historical context of its subject; that is, the sorry history of the blacklist, instituted by the studios after the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) put a gun to their collective heads in 1947.',\n",
       " \"Despite the voluminous literature on the subject, surprisingly little has been written about High Noon. For many years, Billy Wilder's unfriendly words about the so-called Unfriendly Ten who refused to answer questions before HUAC -- Only two of them have talent. The rest are just unfriendly -- passed for the conventional wisdom. Even though Carl Foreman, who hatched the story and wrote the script, had more -- and better -- credits than most of his blacklisted confreres, unlike them he didn't live to finish writing his memoirs. The director, Fred Zinnemann, never made it into the film critic Andrew Sarris's famous Pantheon, and the producer, Stanley Kramer, was condescended to by intellectuals for his message movies.\",\n",
       " \"Glenn Frankel comes to his subject with a widely praised book about John Ford's The Searchers and an impressive r√©um√©n journalism, including a Pulitzer Prize. Although much of Frankel's material is familiar, the blacklist is a gift that keeps on giving. There always seems to be something new to chew on, in this case the transcripts of HUAC's secret executive sessions. Besides, it's a story that bears retelling because Hollywood, not to mention the rest of the country, is haunted by ghosts that won't go away (witness Newt Gingrich's recent call for a resurrection of HUAC, now to be wielded against ISIS, not Communists).\",\n",
       " \"At first HUAC was considered something of a joke, but as time passed, the committee's antics became more scary than risible. Like much of the Hollywood left, Humphrey Bogart supported the 19 unfriendly screenwriters initially called before the committee. He had backed Franklin Roosevelt in his 1944 presidential campaign, and when he was attacked by the right, he struck a defiant note in The Saturday Evening Post. Alluding to his role in Casablanca, he wrote, I'm going to keep right on sticking my neck out, without worrying about its possible effect upon my career. But a brief three years later, when the right turned up the heat, he published an abject apologia in Photoplay magazine entitled, I'm No Communist, in which he distanced himself from the Ten. Likewise, Jack Warner, whose studio had invented the anti-fascist genre, gave HUAC the names of 16 screenwriters, including those of the Epstein twins, of whom he said, Those boys are always on the side of the underdog. Foreman didn't intend his script to be the blacklist parable it became, but as he watched his friends fall around him, it was almost inevitable. Foreman felt like the Gary Cooper character. He regarded High Noon as a picture about conscience versus compromise.\",\n",
       " \"Surprisingly, it is Gary Cooper, a card-carrying conservative, who emerges as one of the few heroes of this story. Called before HUAC in the middle of production, Foreman gave his star the opportunity to leave the picture -- guilt by association was de rigueur in those days -- but Cooper refused. Foreman declined to name names, and Kramer fired him. In Casablanca, the so-called refugee trail led from Europe to America. During the witch hunt years, it went the other way. Moving to London, Foreman said goodbye to his country, his livelihood and, eventually, his marriage. Cooper tried to help him by buying stock in his new company, but bullied by the likes of John Wayne and Hedda Hopper, he eventually pulled out, albeit cordially. If Foreman had thought that art was imitating life in High Noon, once Cooper caved it seemed clear that at least in his life, unlike Marshal Will Kane's, there were no happy endings.\",\n",
       " 'Frankel narrates this story well. He has a sure ear for the telling anecdote, and a good eye for detail. (Parnell Thomas chaired the HUAC hearings sitting on a phone book covered by a red cushion to compensate for his diminutive stature.) The era has been labeled the plague years, but Frankel is forgiving of those caught up in its tangle of principle and expediency, courage and cowardice. He adopts the verdict of Dalton Trumbo, another of the Unfriendly Ten: There were only victims.',\n",
       " 'Correction: March 19, 2017, Sunday',\n",
       " \"This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A review on March 5 about Noah Isenberg's We'll Always Have Casablanca and Glenn Frankel's High Noon misstated the constitutional amendment under which the so-called Unfriendly Ten refused to answer questions before the House Un-American Activities Committee during its investigation of the Hollywood film industry in 1947. The 10 maintained that they were entitled to remain silent under the terms of the First Amendment, not the Fifth.
